### These are my first PYTHON "IMPORT" exercises

##  You will need to use imports to complete each exercise; in addition, these exercise will strengthen your problem solving and python coding skills

## You will be directed to create specific files in part 1, for the rest you may do your work in either import_exercises.py or import_exercises.ipynb

## 1.- Import and test 3 of the functions from your functions exercise file. Import each function in a different way:
## a. Run an interactive python session and import the module. Call the is_vowel function using the . syntax.
## b. Create a file named import_exericses.py. Within this file, use from to import the calculate_tip function directly. Call this function with values you choose and print the result
## c. Create a jupyter notebook named import_exercises.ipynb. Use from to import the get_letter_grade function and give it an alias. Test this function in your notebook
